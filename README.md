To prepare for my 2020 summer internship related to machine learning, I sought out this 
tutorial. Apparently this is the "hello world" equivalent in the world of machine learning
and I thought that this would be a good place to start. I got the tutorial from the
following website: https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/
I'm excited for what this summer has in store for me!
